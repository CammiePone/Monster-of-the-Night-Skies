One of the most hated mobs in Minecraft at the moment is the Phantom, and as the Overworld's only hostile flying mob, it's disappointing to see it relegated to an annoying mechanic that many people disable.

With the Mob Vote officially being nixed, I decided to update Mob B - the Phantom. No more insomnia mechanic, no more packs of Phantoms spawning when you exit a cave, no more incessant screeching in the skies above you while you're minding your own business in your base.

The Phantom now spawns on players flying with the Elytra at night, able to chase you down through the skies. It only has 4 HP, so it can be killed easily if you can hit it. If you land, it will stop attacking you and instead begin to circle above your head, luring all mobs in a large radius to your position. If you stay grounded, the Phantom will despawn after a short while, letting you escape by the air once again.
